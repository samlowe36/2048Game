probably done with this one. Used the article https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/python-2048-game-project-with-source-code/ as a model for this and ended up improving it I think

still has a bug where if you try to force a loss when there are still technically valid moves that couldve been chosen instead, it will crash. probably done tinkering with this and moving on to something else now.
